matplotlib gives you 5 ways to specify colors,

    1) as a single letter string, ala MATLAB

    2) as an html style hex string or html color name

    3) as an R,G,B tuple, where R,G,B, range from 0-1

    4) as a string representing a floating point number
       from 0 to 1, corresponding to shades of gray.

    5) as a special color "Cn", where n is a number 0-9 specifying the
       nth color in the currently active color cycle.

See help(colors) for more info.
