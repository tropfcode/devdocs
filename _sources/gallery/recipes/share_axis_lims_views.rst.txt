Sharing axis limits and views
=============================

It's common to make two or more plots which share an axis, e.g., two
subplots with time as a common axis.  When you pan and zoom around on
one, you want the other to move around with you.  To facilitate this,
matplotlib Axes support a ``sharex`` and ``sharey`` attribute.  When
you create a :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.subplot` or
:func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.axes` instance, you can pass in a keyword
indicating what axes you want to share with
