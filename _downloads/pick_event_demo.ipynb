        "\n# Pick Event Demo\n\n\n\nYou can enable picking by setting the \"picker\" property of an artist\n(for example, a matplotlib Line2D, Text, Patch, Polygon, AxesImage,\netc...)\n\nThere are a variety of meanings of the picker property\n\n    None -  picking is disabled for this artist (default)\n\n    boolean - if True then picking will be enabled and the\n      artist will fire a pick event if the mouse event is over\n      the artist\n\n    float - if picker is a number it is interpreted as an\n      epsilon tolerance in points and the artist will fire\n      off an event if it's data is within epsilon of the mouse\n      event.  For some artists like lines and patch collections,\n      the artist may provide additional data to the pick event\n      that is generated, for example, the indices of the data within\n      epsilon of the pick event\n\n    function - if picker is callable, it is a user supplied\n      function which determines whether the artist is hit by the\n      mouse event.\n\n         hit, props = picker(artist, mouseevent)\n\n      to determine the hit test.  If the mouse event is over the\n      artist, return hit=True and props is a dictionary of properties\n      you want added to the PickEvent attributes\n\n\nAfter you have enabled an artist for picking by setting the \"picker\"\nproperty, you need to connect to the figure canvas pick_event to get\npick callbacks on mouse press events.  For example,\n\n  def pick_handler(event):\n      mouseevent = event.mouseevent\n      artist = event.artist\n      # now do something with this...\n\n\nThe pick event (matplotlib.backend_bases.PickEvent) which is passed to\nyour callback is always fired with two attributes:\n\n  mouseevent - the mouse event that generate the pick event.  The\n    mouse event in turn has attributes like x and y (the coordinates in\n    display space, such as pixels from left, bottom) and xdata, ydata (the\n    coords in data space).  Additionally, you can get information about\n    which buttons were pressed, which keys were pressed, which Axes\n    the mouse is over, etc.  See matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent\n    for details.\n\n  artist - the matplotlib.artist that generated the pick event.\n\nAdditionally, certain artists like Line2D and PatchCollection may\nattach additional meta data like the indices into the data that meet\nthe picker criteria (for example, all the points in the line that are within\nthe specified epsilon tolerance)\n\nThe examples below illustrate each of these methods.\n\n"
